                        <p class="lead mb-20">
                            Social AI blends principles and insights from various domains to create advanced AI systems.
                            Social AI systems are built to interact intelligently and naturally with humans,
                            understanding social cues and emotions, and responding appropriately within any given social context.
                            They go beyond traditional AI capabilities, operating in a way that feels intuitive and
                            facilitating better human-AI interactions.</p>
                        <h3>Emergent Decision-Making</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-20">
                            As AI systems begin operating in real-life social settings, they will exhibit novel
                            decision-making behaviors. We believe that a solid scientific understanding of these
                            behaviors can have two significant implications:</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20"><b>1. Alignment with Evolving Societal Values:</b> This understanding
                            allows us to create feedback mechanisms that align the AI's decisions with desirable societal
                            values. Without this alignment, or the capability to utilize it effectively,
                            even the most advanced Social AI can struggle in complex social scenarios.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20"><b>2. Social and Economic Impacts:</b> Systematic research on these
                            behaviors can help us more accurately gauge the social and economic implications of AI advancements.
                            As AI becomes more complex, it creates intricate social and economic scenarios that
                            traditional research methods may struggle to comprehend.</p>

                        <p class="lead mt-40 mb-20">Panalogy Lab pioneers research on aligning AI systems with evolving
                            human intentions and values in complex social contexts.
                            Our research centers on three main themes:</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20"><b>1. Studying Complex Decision-Making:</b>
                            We're examining how AI systems can make complex decisions akin to human-like choices in a
                            variety of social scenarios, with a special interest in decisions that lack clear 'right'
                            or 'wrong' outcomes. Our current focus is on studying Augmented Language Models (ALMs)
                            through a combination of prompt engineering, multi-modality, and reinforcement learning. </p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20"><b>2. Understanding Behavioral Complexity:</b>
                            We're not only interested in the decisions made but also in the process that led to those
                            decisions, comparing how humans and AI approach decision-making. Given the critical role of
                            human decision-making models (e.g. rationality) in shaping social and economic policies,
                            we see the exploration of Social AI systems' complex decision-making processes as a new frontier
                            in alignment research. We also study the intricate behaviors stemming from human-AI interactions
                            during these decision processes.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20"><b>3. Training AI for Research:</b>
                            Our ultimate vision is to create AI systems capable of conducting their own complex research
                            in the field of Social AI, based on our insights into behavioral complexity.
                            We believe AI systems will soon operate in environments that surpass human comprehension.
                            It’s best to focus our effort on designing AI systems and evaluating their performance
                            while delegating the cognitive load of doing research to these AI systems.

                                    contexts and emergent behaviors demand AI systems with generalized decision-making

                                    An innovative platform designed to analyze emergent alignment behaviors of
                                    Augmented Language Models (ALMs) in complex social contexts. By applying traditional
                                    social behavior survey and experimental methodologies, we systematically evaluate
                                    the ALMs’ attitudes and values as they evolve. This process enables us to gain
                                    unprecedented insights into their alignment dynamics and emergent behaviors.
                                    Furthermore, SurveyLM enhances survey and experiment designs by incorporating
                                    feedback directly from ALMs, effectively accelerating the development and testing
                                    of high-quality survey frameworks. By presenting ALMs with complex, contextualized
                                    questions and decision-making scenarios, we can study how these AI systems
                                    negotiate ethical dilemmas and balance diverse values, ensuring a range of needs
                                    are met across various cultures, languages, and domains. Dive into our

                                    In collaboration with <a href='https://eoh.io/'>EoH.io</a>, we are developing a one-of-a-kind plug-n-learn IoT
                                    development platform. Our AI solutions integrate machine intelligence into EoH's
                                    platform automation process, leading to increased productivity and efficiency for
                                    developers, and facilitating rapid deployment of IoT devices. We have recently
                                    finished an LLM-based solution that autonomously extracts IoT device
                                    configurations from pdfs, transforming them into a universally compatible
                                    firmware-ready JSON format for a variety of manufacturers' IoT device
                                    setup/installation reports and instructions. This is a breakthrough for EoH as the
                                    solution solves a hard and resource-consuming problem that all IoT developers commonly
                                    deal with. Our next milestone for this project is to delve into the
                                    intersection of AI and IoT, taking advantage of cutting-edge solutions such as
                                    Google's <a href='https://coral.ai/'>Coral AI</a>. This progression will allow us to create more dynamic, efficient,
                                    and responsive systems, ushering in a new era of AI-enhanced IoT devices that are not
                                    just connected, but also intelligent and adaptable to ever-changing human needs.</p>

                                    decisions in realistic, dynamic social environments. Central to these models is the
                                    incorporation of Large Learning Models (LLMs) within the learning process.
                                    Our primary focus is on designing applications that enable users to better understand
                                    the agent's decision-making capabilities, and integrate this understanding into
                                    their workflow to increase knowledge and efficiency at scale. Although initially
                                    demonstrated in auction evaluation settings, the potential applications of
