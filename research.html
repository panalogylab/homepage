                            and principles from diverse domains to develop long-lived AI agents capable of interacting
                            with humans and other
                            computational artifacts naturally and intelligently in intricate social environments. These
                            agents can
                            discern social cues, comprehend human emotions, and react in a manner that is both socially
                            appropriate and engaging. They engage with humans in a way that feels natural and intuitive,
                            facilitating communication and augmenting human-AI social interactions and
                            understanding.</p>

                            One crucial aspect of social AI, when the agents start operating in real social
                            environments, is set of
                            emergent behaviours of those environments that will underpin the dynamics of the agents'
                            alignment
                            with human values and intentions. We believe that a solid scientific understanding of those
                            behaviours has two far-reaching implications for successful design and deployment of social
                            AI
                            having desirable alignment properties.

                        <p class="lead mb-20">
                            The first implication is that such an understanding can be used to develop powerful feedback
                            mechanisms
                            that help align the agents' behaviours with desirable social values. Without these
                            mechanisms
                            or the capability to utilize them effectively, a state-of-the-art social AI product may fail
                            hard and fast in
                            complex social context where unexpected behaviours emerge without any effective feedback
                            handling and evaluation.

                        <p class="lead mb-20">
                            The second implication is that being able to scientifically study social AI’s emergent
                            behaviours
                            provide us with a concrete ground for analysing their social and economic impacts on our
                            societies.
                            What is becoming more apparent with the recent development of emergent cognitive
                            capabilities
                            (those not foreseeable at the creation of such AI), is the field of social AI also
                            encompasses the study
                            of the social and economic implications of the rapid advances in artificial intelligence and
                            distributed
                            computing technologies. These recent advances have essentially created complex and dynamic
                            social and economic entanglements that are difficult to analyse and understand using
                            conventional
                            methods and ways of thinking.

                            In this context, social AI research also involves developing new theories and practices that
                            can
                            capture the interactions between humans and intelligent machines in complex social systems.
                            This
                            may involve studying the impact of AI on employment, social inequality, privacy, and other
                            social
                            and economic factors, as well as exploring new approaches to designing and regulating these
                            systems in a way that maximises their benefits while minimising their risks.

                            interacting with humans and other artifacts in real-world complex social environments.
                            Aligning these social AI systems, when they are operating in societies, with evolving
                            human intentions and values is a critical challenge whose complexity we still know little
                            about.
                            At Panalogy Lab, we take an approach to alignment research built upon an interdisciplinary
                            understanding of emergent behaviors of social AI systems within the complex social context
                            in which
                            they operate.
                            Our research focuses on three main themes:</p>

                            Currently, our focus of attention is on studying augmented language models using
                            a mixture of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20">2. Behavioral complexity: We seek to study behavioral complexity of AI
                            systems
                            in evolving complex social context rather than rigidly managed and simplified environments.
                            Currently, we are investigating social settings that are pivotal in human societies.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-20">3. Training AI systems to do research: Our long-term goal is to be able to
                            train
                            AI systems that can effectively do complex social alignment research
                            using our own insights into behavioral complexity.
                            We pursue this approach because we believe social AI systems will soon
                            operate in environments whose complexity will be beyond our capability
                            to understand directly. It’s best to focus our effort on designing
                            AI systems and evaluating their performance while delegating the
                            cognitive load of doing research to these AI systems.</p>

                                <p class="lead mt-40 mb-20">What would be a satisfactory design for an AI system that
                                    operates in
                                    a complex social environment? We structure the design process
                                    using the following insights from our research.</p>
                                <p class="lead mb-20">Social decision-making: We focus on designing systems that must
                                    ultimately make complex decisions in evolving social context.
                                    These decisions are the driving force behind emergent behavioral
                                    complexity that’s the subject of our social AI alignment research.
                                    We believe that complex decision-making is an
                                    important cognitive hurdle that between narrow AI and AGI,
                                    and a focus on this aspect will bring us a step closer to making
                                    contribution to the development of AGI.</p>
                                <p class="lead mb-20">Behavioral uncertainty: As social environments in which an AI
                                    system operates become more complex,
                                    behavioral uncertainty will be a constant factor that our design must take into
                                    account.
                                    Evolving social context and emergent behaviors will eventually lead to situations
                                    never expected before.
                                    Dealing with this challenge is essentially a task of
                                    generalizing decision-making capability to deal with behavioral uncertainty.</p>
                                <p class="lead mb-20">Our current design ideas:</p>
                                <p class="lead mb-20">1. "her": a voice-based conversational AI agent built upon SOTA
                                    LLMs,
                                    speech synthesis AI, prompt engineering, and reinforcement learning. We designed
                                    "her"
                                    with the goal of studying what social behaviors make a conversational AI agent
                                    "natural"
                                    from a human perspective</p>
                                <p class="lead mb-20">2. AI agents in realistic social settings: reinforcement learning
                                    models designed
                                    to operate in realistic social environments such as financial markets, dating, and
                                    sport. One
                                    important aspect of these models is the use of LLMs as part of their learning
                                    process.</p>

                                    (CHIPS): With CHIPS, we ask a forward-looking question: if the future world runs on AI, how would AI agents interpret the past, present, and future
                                    coevolution of science, innovation and policy? What we primarily seek to achieve in our CHIPS project is a deeper and more
                                    coherent understanding of big themes of intellectual history and innovation,
                                    their impacts on societies through policy changes, and implications for future policy design.
                                    The depth and coherence are made possible by LLMss capability to digest a vast amount of natural
                                    language semantically and generate results that can be integrated seamlessly
                                    with other powerful computational methods for complex system analysis.
                                    In essence, CHIPS allows us to combine the benefits of both distant and close reading approaches in our study of intellectual history.</p>
