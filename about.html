          <p class="lead mb-20">Gaining a

          <h2>What Does “<span>Panalogy</span>” Mean?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-20">Panalogy is a term coined by Marvin Minsky, a pioneering figure in the field of
            artificial intelligence
            to describe “parallel analogy”.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            In some instances, Panalogy refers to a holistic approach to learning and knowledge acquisition,
            where different disciplinary areas and ideas are integrated to obtain a more comprehensive
            understanding of a given topic. This perspective acknowledges that complex phenomena often
            require multiple perspectives to be fully understood.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            Structurally, Panalogy allows for easy and rapid switching between different modes of thinking.
            While it is useful to know various ways to achieve a specific goal, each of these ways is connected to
            a larger structure. Thus, Panalogy enables us to use the same structure to serve several purposes by
            changing the contexts or realms of knowledge entered into its analogous slots, as Minsky pointed
            out.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            The beauty of this approach is that each perspective can help overcome some deficiencies and
            limitations of the others.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            In other settings, panalogy has been used to describe the study of all knowledge (pan=all,
            logos=knowledge), or as a synonym for omniscience like that expected of futuristic, strong and
            general AI.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            According to Minsky, panalogy is a way of thinking that involves looking for similarities and patterns
            across different domains or fields, and using these analogies to generate new ideas and solutions. He
            argued that a truly comprehensive understanding of intelligence would require a synthesis of these 3
            different perspectives, as well as the development of new theories and methods that could bridge
            the gaps between them.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            In other words, panalogy is a creative process of finding connections and insights by exploring the
            relationships between seemingly unrelated concepts or domains. Minsky believed that this approach
            was essential for developing new technologies, solving complex problems, and advancing our
            understanding of complex systems, intelligence and the intelligent agents (humans, animals and
            artificial) who inhabit this world.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            Overall, panalogy, while not a very common term, can be seen as an attempt to approach
            knowledge and understanding in a more comprehensive and integrated way, and as a recognition of
            the limitations inherent in a too-narrow disciplinary focus.
            Panalogy Lab therefore represents a bold vision for the future of science and technology, one that seeks
            to break down the boundaries between different disciplines and explore the interconnectedness of all
            things while always situating this perspective in realistic social context.</p>

          <h2>What is “<span>Social AI</span>” Research?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-20">At Panalogy Lab, we perceive Social AI as an emerging field that amalgamates insights
            and principles
            from diverse domains to develop long-lived AI agents capable of interacting with humans and other
            computational artifacts naturally and intelligently in intricate social environments. These agents can
            discern social cues, comprehend human emotions, and react in a manner that is both socially
            appropriate and engaging. They engage with humans in a way that feels natural and intuitive,
            facilitating communication and augmenting human-AI social interactions and understanding.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            One crucial aspect of social AI, when the agents start operating in real social environments, is set of
            emergent behaviours of those environments that will underpin the dynamics of the agents' alignment
            with human values and intentions. We believe that a solid scientific understanding of those
            behaviours has two far-reaching implications for successful design and deployment of social AI
            having desirable alignment properties.
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            The first implication is that such an understanding can be used to develop powerful feedback mechanisms
            that help align the agents' behaviours with desirable social values. Without these mechanisms
            or the capability to utilize them effectively, a state-of-the-art social AI product may fail hard and fast in
            complex social context where unexpected behaviours emerge without any effective feedback
            handling and evaluation.
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            The second implication is that being able to scientifically study social AI’s emergent behaviours
            provide us with a concrete ground for analysing their social and economic impacts on our societies.
            What is becoming more apparent with the recent development of emergent cognitive capabilities
            (those not foreseeable at the creation of such AI), is the field of social AI also encompasses the study
            of the social and economic implications of the rapid advances in artificial intelligence and distributed
            computing technologies. These recent advances have essentially created complex and dynamic
            social and economic entanglements that are difficult to analyse and understand using conventional
            methods and ways of thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            In this context, social AI research also involves developing new theories and practices that can
            capture the interactions between humans and intelligent machines in complex social systems. This
            may involve studying the impact of AI on employment, social inequality, privacy, and other social
            and economic factors, as well as exploring new approaches to designing and regulating these
            systems in a way that maximises their benefits while minimising their risks.
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            At Panalogy Lab, we focus on designing social AI based on concrete scientific understanding of their
            emergent social behaviours, hoping to create innovative solutions that break down disciplinary
            boundaries and explore the interconnectedness of all things. Our commitment to lifelong learning,
            scientific rigour and sound empirical research allows us to deliver solutions that are based on an
            interdisplinary understanding of behavioural complexity and uncertainties in real-world social
            settings.
          </p>
          <p class="lead mb-20">
            We believe that social AI has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with the
            world around us. we are proud to be leading the way in social AI research and design, and are
            committed to creating new value for research communities and policy makers as we continue to
            explore the possibilities of social AI and its transformative potential.
